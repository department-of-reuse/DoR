Furthermore, research is sometimes critically reviewed for characteristics inherent to the methods. We adopt a taxonomy from the social sciences, termed here the ABC framework for SE research, which offers a holistic view of eight archetypal research strategies. ABC refers to the research goal that strives for generalizability over Actors (A) and precise measurement of their Behavior (B), in a realistic Context (C). The ABC framework uses two dimensions widely considered to be key in research design: the level of obtrusiveness of the research and the generalizability of research findings. We discuss metaphors for each strategy and their inherent limitations and potential strengths. We illustrate these research strategies in two key SE domains, global software engineering and requirements engineering, and apply the framework on a sample of 75 articles. Finally, we discuss six ways in which the framework can advance SE research.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3241743","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,17]],"date-time":"2018-09-17T12:14:54.000Z","timestamp":1537186494000},"page":"1-51","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":17,"title":["The ABC of Software Engineering Research"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"Klaas-Jan","family":"Stol","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Limerick, Ireland"},{"name":"University College Cork and Lero—the Irish Software Research Centre, Ireland"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Brian","family":"Fitzgerald","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Limerick, Ireland"},{"name":"University of Limerick and Lero—the Irish Software Research Centre, Ireland"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":[{}],"container-title":["ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3241743","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]],"date-time":"2021-03-02T14:03:20.000Z","timestamp":1614693800000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,8]]},"references-count":232,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/3241743"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3241743","relation":{},"ISSN":["1049-331X","1557-7392"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1049-331X"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1557-7392"}],"subject":["Software"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,8]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T16:46:44.000Z","timestamp":1626454004051},"publisher-location":"Cham","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","isbn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"9783319105741"},{"type":"electronic","value":"9783319105758"}],"license":[{"URL":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","start":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]],"date-time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1514764800000},"delay-in-days":0,"content-version":"unspecified"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,18]],"date-time":"2018-05-18T08:05:28.000Z","timestamp":1526630728000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":88,"title":["Handbook of Model Checking"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[],"member":"297","container-title":[],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,18]],"date-time":"2018-05-18T08:05:28.000Z","timestamp":1526630728000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"editor":[{"given":"Edmund M.","family":"Clarke","affiliation":[],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Thomas A.","family":"Henzinger","affiliation":[],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Helmut","family":"Veith","affiliation":[],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Roderick","family":"Bloem","affiliation":[],"sequence":"additional"}],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"ISBN":["9783319105741","9783319105758"],"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2018]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T15:04:55.000Z","timestamp":1626447895984},"reference-count":44,"publisher":"Wiley","issue":"3","license":[{"URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1","start":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,1]],"date-time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1441065600000},"delay-in-days":904,"content-version":"tdm"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Nurs Health Sci"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"DOI":"10.1111/nhs.12048","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,13]],"date-time":"2013-03-13T05:15:10.000Z","timestamp":1363151710000},"page":"398-405","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2354,"title":["Content analysis and thematic analysis: Implications for conducting a qualitative descriptive study"],"prefix":"10.1111","volume":"15","author":[{"given":"Mojtaba","family":"Vaismoradi","affiliation":[],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Hannele","family":"Turunen","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Nursing Science;

present a novel approach to proving the absence of timing channels. The idea is to partition the program's execution traces in such a way that each partition component is checked for timing attack resilience by a time complexity analysis and that per-component resilience implies the resilience of the whole program. We construct a partition by splitting the program traces at secret-independent branches. This ensures that any pair of traces with the same public input has a component containing both traces. Crucially, the per-component checks can be normal safety properties expressed in terms of a single execution. Our approach is thus in contrast to prior approaches, such as self-composition, that aim to reason about multiple (\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            ≥ 2) executions at once.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            We formalize the above as an approach called quotient partitioning, generalized to any\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            -safety property, and prove it to be sound. A key feature of our approach is a demand-driven partitioning strategy that uses a regex-like notion called trails to identify sets of execution traces, particularly those influenced by tainted (or secret) data. We have applied our technique in a prototype implementation tool called Blazer, based on WALA, PPL, and the brics automaton library. We have proved timing-channel freedom of (or synthesized an attack specification for) 24 programs written in Java bytecode, including 6 classic examples from the literature and 6 examples extracted from the DARPA STAC challenge problems.\n

At the same time, smartphone users are plagued by carelessly programmed apps that leak important data by accident, and by malicious apps that exploit their given privileges to copy such data intentionally. While existing static taint-analysis approaches have the potential of detecting such data leaks ahead of time, all approaches for Android use a number of coarse-grain approximations that can yield high numbers of missed leaks and false alarms.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In this work we thus present FlowDroid, a novel and highly precise static taint analysis for Android applications. A precise model of Android's lifecycle allows the analysis to properly handle callbacks invoked by the Android framework, while context, flow, field and object-sensitivity allows the analysis to reduce the number of false alarms. Novel on-demand algorithms help FlowDroid maintain high efficiency and precision at the same time.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We also propose DroidBench, an open test suite for evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of taint-analysis tools specifically for Android apps. As we show through a set of experiments using SecuriBench Micro, DroidBench, and a set of well-known Android test applications, FlowDroid finds a very high fraction of data leaks while keeping the rate of false positives low. On DroidBench, FlowDroid achieves 93% recall and 86% precision, greatly outperforming the commercial tools IBM AppScan Source and Fortify SCA. FlowDroid successfully finds leaks in a subset of 500 apps from Google Play and about 1,000 malware apps from the VirusShare project.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/2666356.2594299","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,5]],"date-time":"2014-09-05T19:12:56.000Z","timestamp":1409944376000},"page":"259-269","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":499,"title":["FlowDroid"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"49","author":[{"given":"Steven","family":"Arzt","affiliation":[{"name":"EC SPRIDE, Technische Universität, Darmstadt"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Siegfried","family":"Rasthofer","affiliation":[{"name":"EC SPRIDE, Technische Universität, Darmstadt"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Christian","family":"Fritz","affiliation":[{"name":"EC SPRIDE, Technische Universität, Darmstadt"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Eric","family":"Bodden","affiliation":[{"name":"Paderborn University, Germany"},{"name":"EC SPRIDE, Technische Universität, Darmstadt"},{"name":"Technische Universität Darmstadt &amp;

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3065386","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,25]],"date-time":"2017-05-25T16:16:45.000Z","timestamp":1495729005000},"page":"84-90","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5969,"title":["ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"60","author":[{"given":"Alex","family":"Krizhevsky","affiliation":[{"name":"Google Inc"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Ilya","family":"Sutskever","affiliation":[{"name":"Google Inc"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Geoffrey E.","family":"Hinton","affiliation":[{"name":"OpenAI"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":[{}],"container-title":["Communications of the ACM"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3065386","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]],"date-time":"2021-03-02T19:20:29.000Z","timestamp":1614712829000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]},"references-count":32,"journal-issue":{"issue":"6"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/3065386"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3065386","relation":{},"ISSN":["0001-0782","1557-7317"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"0001-0782"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1557-7317"}],"subject":["General Computer Science"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]],"date-time":"2021-07-14T05:45:40.000Z","timestamp":1626241540898},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"12","funder":[{"name":"National Key R&#x0026;D Program of China","award":["2016YFB1000701"]},{"name":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","DOI":"10.13039/501100001809","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["61772299","71690231","61502265"]},{"name":"DARPA Program on Lifelong Learning Machines"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IEEE Trans.

This knowledge has been used pervasively in quantitative studies of software through practices such as normalization on size metrics. This paper reports size-related super- and sublinear effects that have not been known before. Findings obtained on a very large collection of Java programs -- 30,911 projects hosted at Google Code as of Summer 2011 -- unveils how certain characteristics of programs vary disproportionately with program size, sometimes even non-monotonically. Many of the specific parameters of nonlinear relations are reported. This result gives further insights for the differences of ``programming in the small'' vs. ``programming in the large.'' The reported findings carry important consequences for OO software metrics, and software research in general: metrics that have been known to correlate with size can now be properly normalized so that

extent these origins affect research practice across the globe. The article begins a conversation with international researchers who review using grounded theory in their countries and cultures. Their reviews reveal the significance of (a) shared meanings, (b) contradictions between data collection techniques and cultural practices, (c) tensions between coding in English and native languages, (d) points of cultural convergence and grounded theory strategies, and (e) local constraints. In conclusion, the article calls for attending to how the national and cultural underpinnings of methodological approaches affect inquiry. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177/1077800414545235","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,29]],"date-time":"2014-08-29T03:24:07.000Z","timestamp":1409282647000},"page":"1074-1084","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":57,"title":["Grounded Theory in Global Perspective"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"20","author":[{"given":"Kathy","family":"Charmaz","affiliation":[{"name":"Sonoma State University, Rohnert Park, CA, USA"}],"sequence":"first"}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,28]]},"reference":[{}],"container-title":["Qualitative Inquiry"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414545235","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full-xml/10.1177/1077800414545235","content-type":"application/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414545235","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]],"date-time":"2021-05-07T14:11:36.000Z","timestamp":1620396696000},"score":1,"subtitle":["Reviews by International Researchers"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,28]]},"references-count":49,"journal-issue":{"issue":"9"},"alternative-id":["10.1177/1077800414545235"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077800414545235","relation":{},"ISSN":["1077-8004","1552-7565"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1077-8004"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1552-7565"}],"subject":["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Anthropology"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,28]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T17:46:20.000Z","timestamp":1626457580038},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Wiley","issue":"3","license":[{"URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1","start":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,1]],"date-time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1441065600000},"delay-in-days":6574,"content-version":"tdm"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["J Adv Nurs"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1997,9]]},"DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.t01-25-00999.x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,12]],"date-time":"2003-03-12T03:34:58.000Z","timestamp":1047440098000},"page":"623-630","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":856,"title":["Sampling in qualitative research.

But researchers rarely report or discuss coding reliability in this work. Nor is there much literature on the subject for this type of data. This article presents a procedure for developing coding schemes for such data. It involves standardizing the units of text on which coders work and then improving the coding scheme’s discriminant capability (i.e., reducing coding errors) to an acceptable point as indicated by measures of either intercoder reliability or intercoder agreement. This approach is especially useful for situations where a single knowledgeable coder will code all the transcripts once the coding scheme has been established. This approach can also be used with other types of qualitative data and in other circumstances.

Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first white-box framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets such as ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3%.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3361566","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,24]],"date-time":"2019-10-24T19:02:07.000Z","timestamp":1571943727000},"page":"137-145","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["DeepXplore"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"62","author":[{"given":"Kexin","family":"Pei","affiliation":[{"name":"Columbia

CC and OR are one-sided metrics while IG and CHI are two-sided. Feature selection using one-sided metrics selects the features most indicative of membership only, while feature selection using two-sided metrics implicitly combines the features most indicative of membership (e.g. positive features) and non-membership (e.g. negative features) by ignoring the signs of features. The former never consider the negative features, which are quite valuable, while the latter cannot ensure the optimal combination of the two kinds of features especially on imbalanced data. In this work, we investigate the usefulness of explicit control of that combination within a proposed feature selection framework. Using multinomial naïve Bayes and regularized logistic regression as classifiers, our experiments show both great potential and actual merits of explicitly combining positive and negative features in a nearly optimal fashion according to the imbalanced

This approach gives rise to the generation of possibly billions of variants, which, however, cannot be efficiently analyzed for bugs and other properties with classic analysis techniques. To address this issue, researchers and practitioners have developed sampling heuristics and, recently, variability-aware analysis techniques. While sampling reduces the analysis effort significantly, the information obtained is necessarily incomplete, and it is unknown whether state-of-the-art sampling techniques scale to billions of variants. Variability-aware analysis techniques process the configurable code base directly, exploiting similarities among individual variants with the goal of reducing analysis effort. However, while being promising, so far, variability-aware analysis techniques have been applied mostly only to small academic examples. To learn about the mutual strengths and weaknesses of variability-aware and sample-based static-analysis techniques, we compared the two by means of seven concrete control-flow and data-flow analyses, applied to five real-world subject systems: B\n            <jats:sc>usybox</jats:sc>\n            , O\n            <jats:sc>pen</jats:sc>\n            SSL, SQL\n            <jats:sc>ite</jats:sc>\n            , the x86 L\n            <jats:sc>inux</jats:sc>\n            kernel, and\n            <jats:sc>u</jats:sc>\n            C\n            <jats:sc>libc</jats:sc>\n            . In particular, we compare the efficiency (analysis execution time) of the static analyses and their effectiveness (potential bugs found). Overall, we found that variability-aware analysis outperforms most sample-based static-analysis techniques with respect to efficiency and effectiveness. For example, checking all variants of O\n            <jats:sc>pen</jats:sc>\n            SSL with a variability-aware static analysis is faster than checking even only two variants with an analysis that does not exploit similarities among variants.\n

become an essential research task to accelerate modern software development. To facilitate effective code completion for dynamically-typed programming languages, we apply neural language models by learning from large codebases, and develop a tailored attention mechanism for code completion. However, standard neural language models even with attention mechanism cannot correctly predict the out-of-vocabulary (OoV) words that restrict the code completion performance. In this paper, inspired by the prevalence of locally repeated terms in program source code, and the recently proposed pointer copy mechanism, we propose a pointer mixture network for better predicting OoV words in code completion. Based on the context, the pointer mixture network learns to either generate a within-vocabulary word through an RNN component, or regenerate an OoV word from local context through a pointer component. Experiments on two benchmarked datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attention mechanism and pointer mixture network on the code completion task.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.24963/ijcai.2018/578","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,5]],"date-time":"2018-07-05T01:49:10.000Z","timestamp":1530755350000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Code

systems aim to provide quick feedback on the success of the code changes by keeping on building the entire systems upon code changes are committed. However, building the entire software system is usually resource and time consuming. Thus, build outcome prediction is usually employed to distinguish the successful builds from the failed ones to cut the building efforts on those successful builds that do not result in any immediate action of the developer. Nevertheless, build outcome prediction in CI is challenging since the learner should be able to learn from a stream of build events with and without the build outcome labels and provide immediate prediction on the next build event. Also, the distribution of the successful and the failed builds are often highly imbalanced. Unfortunately, the existing methods fail to address these challenges well. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a semi-supervised online AUC optimization method for CI build outcome prediction. Experiments indicate that our method is able to cut the software building efforts by effectively identify the successful builds, and it outperforms the existing methods that elaborate to address part of these challenges.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.24963/ijcai.2018/399","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,5]],"date-time":"2018-07-05T05:49:10.000Z","timestamp":1530769750000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Cutting

The goal of constant propagation is to discover values that are constant on all possible executions of a program and to propagate these constant values as far foward through the program as possible. Expressions whose operands are all constants can be evaluated at compile time and the results propagated further. Using the algorithms presented in this paper can produce smaller and faster compiled programs. The same algorithms can be used for other kinds of analyses (e.g., type of determination). We present four algorithms in this paper, all\n            <jats:italic>conservitive</jats:italic>\n            in the sense that all constants may not be found, but each constant found is constant over all possible executions of the program. These algorithms are among the simplest, fastest, and most powerful global constant propagation algorithms known. We also present a new algorithm that performs a form of interprocedural data flow analysis in which aliasing information is gathered in conjunction with constant progagation.

We consider the human-written patch as ground truth oracle and randomly generate tests based on it, a technique proposed by Shamshiri et al., called Random testing with Ground Truth (RGT) in this paper. We build a curated dataset of 638 patches for Defects4J generated by 14 state-of-the-art repair systems, we evaluate automated patch assessment on this dataset. The results of this study are novel and significant: First, we improve the state of the art performance of automatic patch assessment with RGT by 190% by improving the oracle; Second, we show that RGT is reliable enough to help scientists to do overfitting analysis when they evaluate program repair systems; Third, we improve the external validity of the program repair knowledge with the largest study ever.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]],"date-time":"2021-02-23T15:04:57.000Z","timestamp":1614092697000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Automated patch assessment for program repair at scale"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"26","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4807-2110","given":"He","family":"Ye","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":false,"sequence":"first"},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2945-866X","given":"Matias","family":"Martinez","affiliation":[{"name":"Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France, France"},{"name":"University of Lugano, Switzerland"},{"name":"Polytechnic University of Hauts-de-France, France"},{"name":"INRIA, University of Lille, Lille, France"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Martin","family":"Monperrus","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Lille, France / Inria, France"},{"name":"University of Lille & INRIA, France"},{"name":"Department of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 7655 Stockholm, Stockholm Sweden (e-mail: martin.monperrus@csc.kth.se)"},{"name":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"},{"name":"INRIA, University of Lille, Lille, France"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"reference":[{}],"container-title":["Empirical Software Engineering"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w/fulltext.html","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,26]],"date-time":"2021-03-26T19:15:15.000Z","timestamp":1616786115000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"references-count":76,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"alternative-id":["9920"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w","relation":{},"ISSN":["1382-3256","1573-7616"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1382-3256"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1573-7616"}],"subject":["Software"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"assertion":[{"group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"},"name":"accepted","value":"6 November 2020","order":1},{"group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"},"name":"first_online","value":"23 February 2021","order":2}],"article-number":"20"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,11]],"date-time":"2021-06-11T19:48:24.000Z","timestamp":1623440904136},"reference-count":24,"publisher":"Institute of Electronics, Information and Communications Engineers (IEICE)","issue":"10","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IEICE Trans.

However, their availability in multiple LODs and in the CityGML format is still problematic in practice. This hinders applications and experiments where multi-LOD datasets are required as input, for instance, to determine the performance of different LODs in a spatial analysis. An alternative approach to obtain 3D city models is to generate them with procedural modelling, which is – as we discuss in this paper – well suited as a method to source multi-LOD datasets useful for a number of applications. However, procedural modelling has not yet been employed for this purpose. Therefore, we have developed RANDOM3DCITY, an experimental procedural modelling engine for generating synthetic datasets of buildings and other urban features. The engine is designed to produce models in CityGML and does so in multiple LODs. Besides the generation of multiple geometric LODs, we implement the realisation of multiple levels of spatiosemantic coherence, geometric reference variants, and indoor representations. As a result of their permutations, each building can be generated in 392 different CityGML representations, an unprecedented number of modelling variants of the same feature. The datasets produced by RANDOM3DCITY are suited for several applications, as we show in this paper with documented uses.

datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1613/jair.953","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,12]],"date-time":"2018-07-12T09:11:50.000Z","timestamp":1531386710000},"page":"321-357","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7298,"title":["SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique"],"prefix":"10.1613","volume":"16","author":[{"given":"N.

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a\n            <jats:italic>degree</jats:italic>\n            of being an outlier. This degree is called the\n            <jats:italic>local outlier factor</jats:italic>\n            (LOF) of an object. It is\n            <jats:italic>local</jats:italic>\n            in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.\n

When these rules are violated by programmers who are unaware of or forget about them, defects can be easily introduced. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have tools to automatically extract such rules and also to automatically detect violations. Previous work in this direction focuses on simple function-pair based programming rules and additionally requires programmers to provide rule templates.This paper proposes a\n            <jats:italic>general</jats:italic>\n            method called PR-Miner that uses a data mining technique called frequent itemset mining to efficiently extract implicit programming rules from large software code written in an industrial programming language such as C,\n            <jats:italic>requiring little effort from programmers and no prior knowledge of the software</jats:italic>\n            . Benefiting from frequent itemset mining, PR-Miner can extract programming rules in general forms (without being constrained by any fixed rule templates) that can contain multiple program elements of various types such as functions, variables and data types. In addition, we also propose an efficient algorithm to automatically detect violations to the extracted programming rules, which are strong indications of bugs.Our evaluation with large software code, including Linux, PostgreSQL Server and the Apache HTTP Server, with 84K--3M lines of code each, shows that PR-Miner can efficiently extract thousands of general programming rules and detect violations within 2 minutes. Moreover, PR-Miner has detected many violations to the extracted rules. Among the top 60 violations reported by PR-Miner, 16 have been confirmed as bugs in the\n            <jats:italic>latest version</jats:italic>\n            of Linux, 6 in PostgreSQL and 1 in Apache. Most of them violate complex programming rules that contain more than 2 elements and are thereby difficult for previous tools to detect. We reported these bugs and they are currently being fixed by developers.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/1095430.1081755","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,11,7]],"date-time":"2005-11-07T19:28:32.000Z","timestamp":1131391712000},"page":"306-315","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":66,"title":["PR-Miner"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"30","author":[{"given":"Zhenmin","family":"Li","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Yuanyuan","family":"Zhou","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":[{}],"container-title":["ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1095430.1081755","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,20]],"date-time":"2021-02-20T20:23:28.000Z","timestamp":1613852608000},"score":1,"subtitle":["automatically extracting implicit programming rules and detecting violations in large software code"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9]]},"references-count":31,"journal-issue":{"issue":"5"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/1095430.1081755"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1095430.1081755","relation":{},"ISSN":["0163-5948"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"0163-5948"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2005,9]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,17]],"date-time":"2021-07-17T00:24:17.000Z","timestamp":1626481457945},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":55,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background","start":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,20]],"date-time":"2016-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1453248000000},"delay-in-days":9,"content-version":"vor"}],"funder":[{"name":"National Science Foundation","DOI":"10.13039/100000001","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["1138994"]},{"name":"Defense Sciences Office, DARPA","DOI":"10.13039/100006502","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["FA8750-13-2-0008"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,11]]},"DOI":"10.1145/2837614.2837664","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,7]],"date-time":"2016-01-07T14:05:00.000Z","timestamp":1452175500000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":61,"title":["Learning invariants using decision trees and implication counterexamples"],"prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Pranav","family":"Garg","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Neider","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"P.","family":"Madhusudan","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Dan","family":"Roth","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,11]]},"reference":[{}],"container-title":["Proceedings of the 43rd Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages"],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2837614.2837664","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]],"date-time":"2020-12-21T14:56:47.000Z","timestamp":1608562607000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,11]]},"references-count":55,"alternative-id":["10.1145/2837614.2837664","10.1145/2837614"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2837614.2837664","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,11]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T16:48:00.000Z","timestamp":1626454080575},"reference-count":43,"publisher":"IEEE","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"DOI":"10.1109/icst.2019.00032","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,6]],"date-time":"2019-06-06T23:20:03.000Z","timestamp":1559863203000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Uniform Sampling of SAT Solutions for Configurable Systems: Are We There Yet?"],"prefix":"10.1109","author":[{"given":"Quentin","family":"Plazar","affiliation":[],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Mathieu","family":"Acher","affiliation":[{"name":"Univ.

It is able to efficiently analyze many configurations by aggressively sharing redundancies of program executions. The idea of variational execution has been demonstrated to be effective in exploring variations in the program, especially when the configuration space grows out of control. Existing implementations of variational execution often require heavy lifting of the runtime interpreter, which is painstaking and error-prone. Furthermore, the performance of this approach is suboptimal. For example, the state-of-the-art variational execution interpreter for Java, VarexJ, slows down executions by 100 to 800 times over a single execution for small to medium size Java programs. Instead of modifying existing JVMs, we propose to transform existing bytecode to make it variational, so it can be executed on an unmodified commodity JVM. Our evaluation shows a dramatic improvement on performance over the state-of-the-art, with a speedup of 2 to 46 times, and high efficiency in sharing computations.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3276487","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,24]],"date-time":"2018-10-24T11:57:18.000Z","timestamp":1540382238000},"page":"1-30","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Faster

files and jar files). Since archive size is directly proportional to download time, it is desirable for applications to be as small as possible. This paper is concerned with the use of program transformations such as removal of dead methods and fields, inlining of method calls, and simplification of the class hierarchy for reducing application size. Such “extraction” techniques are generally believed to be especially useful for applications that use class libraries, since typically only a small fraction of a library's functionality is used. By “pruning away” unused library functionality, application size can be reduced dramatically. We implemented a number of application extraction techniques in Jax, an application extractor for Java, and evaluate their effectiveness on a set of realistic benchmarks ranging from 27 to 2,332 classes (with archives ranging from 56,796 to 3,810,120 bytes). We report archive size reductions ranging from 13.4% to 90.2% (48.7% on average).</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/320385.320414","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,11,14]],"date-time":"2005-11-14T18:08:27.000Z","timestamp":1131991707000},"page":"292-305","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Practical experience with an application extractor for Java"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"34","author":[{"given":"Frank","family":"Tip","affiliation":[{"name":"IBM T.J.

However, we do not know how Java developers have adapted to the functional style of thinking, and more importantly, what are the reasons motivating Java developers to adopt functional programming. Without such knowledge, researchers miss opportunities to improve the state of the art, tool builders use unrealistic assumptions, language designers fail to improve upon their designs, and developers are unable to explore efficient and effective use of lambdas.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We present the first large-scale, quantitative and qualitative empirical study to shed light on how imperative programmers use lambda expressions as a gateway into functional thinking. Particularly, we statically scrutinize the source code of 241 open-source projects with 19,770 contributors, to study the characteristics of 100,540 lambda expressions. Moreover, we investigate the historical trends and adoption rates of lambdas in the studied projects. To get a complementary perspective, we seek the underlying reasons on why developers introduce lambda expressions, by surveying 97 developers who are introducing lambdas in their projects, using the firehouse interview method.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Among others, our findings revealed an increasing trend in the adoption of lambdas in Java: in 2016, the ratio of lambdas introduced per added line of code increased by 54% compared to 2015. Lambdas were used for various reasons, including but not limited to (i) making existing code more succinct and readable, (ii) avoiding code duplication, and (iii) simulating lazy evaluation of functions. Interestingly, we found out that developers are using Java's built-in functional interfaces inefficiently, i.e., they prefer to use general functional interfaces over the specialized ones, overlooking the performance overheads that might be imposed.

Instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values. The execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic formulas over the input symbols. The difficult, yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of conditional branch type statements. A particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described. It interpretively executes programs written in a simple PL/I style programming language. It includes many standard debugging features, the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program verifier.

For instance, a security researcher who has run the fuzzer for a week has currently\n            <jats:italic>no</jats:italic>\n            means (1) to estimate the total number of\n            <jats:italic>feasible</jats:italic>\n            program branches, given that only a fraction has been covered so far; (2) to estimate the additional time required to cover 10% more branches (or to estimate the coverage achieved in one more day, respectively); or (3) to assess the residual risk that a vulnerability exists when no vulnerability has been discovered. Failing to discover a vulnerability does not mean that none exists—even if the fuzzer was run for a week (or a year). Hence, testing provides\n            <jats:italic>no formal correctness guarantees</jats:italic>\n            .\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            In this article, I establish an unexpected connection with the otherwise unrelated scientific field of\n            <jats:italic>ecology</jats:italic>\n            and introduce a statistical framework that models Software Testing and Analysis as Discovery of Species (STADS). For instance, in order to study the species diversity of arthropods in a tropical rain forest, ecologists would first sample a large number of individuals from that forest, determine their species, and extrapolate from the properties observed in the sample to properties of the whole forest. The estimations (1) of the total number of species, (2) of the additional sampling effort required to discover 10% more species, or (3) of the probability to discover a new species are classical problems in ecology. The STADS framework draws from over three decades of research in ecological biostatistics to address the fundamental extrapolation challenge for automated test generation. Our preliminary empirical study demonstrates a good estimator performance even for a fuzzer with adaptive sampling bias—AFL, a state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tool. The STADS framework provides\n            <jats:italic>statistical correctness guarantees</jats:italic>\n            with quantifiable accuracy.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3210309","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,27]],"date-time":"2018-06-27T12:14:36.000Z","timestamp":1530101676000},"page":"1-52","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["STADS"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"Marcel","family":"Böhme","affiliation":[{"name":"Monash University, Australia"},{"name":"Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"},{"name":"National University of Singapore, Singapore"},{"name":"National University of Singapore and Monash University, Australia"},{"name":"National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":[{}],"container-title":["ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3210309","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]],"date-time":"2021-03-02T09:54:26.000Z","timestamp":1614678866000},"score":1,"subtitle":["Software Testing as Species Discovery"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,19]]},"references-count":132,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/3210309"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3210309","relation":{},"ISSN":["1049-331X","1557-7392"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1049-331X"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1557-7392"}],"subject":["Software"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,19]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,17]],"date-time":"2021-07-17T00:24:36.000Z","timestamp":1626481476345},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":59,"publisher":"ACM","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,21]]},"DOI":"10.1145/1985793.1985795","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,24]],"date-time":"2011-05-24T13:04:30.000Z","timestamp":1306242270000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":353,"title":["A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering"],"prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Andrea","family":"Arcuri","affiliation":[{"name":"Simula Research Laboratory; P.O.

However, their availability in multiple LODs and in the CityGML format is still problematic in practice. This hinders applications and experiments where multi-LOD datasets are required as input, for instance, to determine the performance of different LODs in a spatial analysis. An alternative approach to obtain 3D city models is to generate them with procedural modelling, which is – as we discuss in this paper – well suited as a method to source multi-LOD datasets useful for a number of applications. However, procedural modelling has not yet been employed for this purpose. Therefore, we have developed RANDOM3DCITY, an experimental procedural modelling engine for generating synthetic datasets of buildings and other urban features. The engine is designed to produce models in CityGML and does so in multiple LODs. Besides the generation of multiple geometric LODs, we implement the realisation of multiple levels of spatiosemantic coherence, geometric reference variants, and indoor representations. As a result of their permutations, each building can be generated in 392 different CityGML representations, an unprecedented number of modelling variants of the same feature. The datasets produced by RANDOM3DCITY are suited for several applications, as we show in this paper with documented uses. The developed engine is available under an open-source licence at Github at http://github.com/tudelft3d/Random3Dcity.\n                    </jats:p>","DOI":"10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-4-w1-51-2016","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,6]],"date-time":"2016-09-06T12:57:52.000Z","timestamp":1473166672000},"page":"51-59","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":["GENERATION OF MULTI-LOD 3D CITY MODELS IN CITYGML WITH THE PROCEDURAL MODELLING ENGINE RANDOM3DCITY"],"prefix":"10.5194","volume":"IV-4/W1","author":[{"given":"F.","family":"Biljecki","affiliation":[],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"H.","family":"Ledoux","affiliation":[],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"J.","family":"Stoter","affiliation":[],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"3145","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,5]]},"container-title":["ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-4-W1/51/2016/isprs-annals-IV-4-W1-51-2016.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]],"date-time":"2021-06-21T10:53:06.000Z","timestamp":1624272786000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,5]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-4-w1-51-2016","relation":{},"ISSN":["2194-9050"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2194-9050"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,5]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]],"date-time":"2021-06-29T15:07:15.000Z","timestamp":1624979235742},"reference-count":59,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"5","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IIEEE Trans.

For instance, such data completion tasks arise in the context of\n            <jats:italic>missing value imputation</jats:italic>\n            in data science and\n            <jats:italic>derived data</jats:italic>\n            computation in spreadsheets and relational databases. Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically struggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming expertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data completion tasks using\n            <jats:italic>programming-by-example (PBE)</jats:italic>\n            and a very lightweight sketching approach. Given a\n            <jats:italic>formula sketch</jats:italic>\n            (e.g., AVG(?\n            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\n            , ?\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            )) and a few input-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to automate the desired data completion task. Towards this goal, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) that combines spatial and relational reasoning over tabular data and a novel synthesis algorithm that can generate DSL programs that are consistent with the input-output examples. The key technical novelty of our approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based on\n            <jats:italic>finite tree automata</jats:italic>\n            (FTA). The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads to a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that are consistent with the examples. We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called DACE and evaluate it on 84 benchmarks taken from online help forums. We also illustrate the advantages of our approach by comparing our technique against two existing synthesizers, namely Prose and Sketch.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3133886","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,13]],"date-time":"2017-10-13T15:15:45.000Z","timestamp":1507907745000},"page":"1-26","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Synthesis of data completion scripts using finite tree automata"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Xinyu","family":"Wang","affiliation":[{"name":"Zhejiang University"},{"name":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"name":"University of Texas at Austin, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Isil","family":"Dillig","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"},{"name":"University of Texas at Austin, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Rishabh","family":"Singh","affiliation":[{"name":"Microsoft Research, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":[{}],"container-title":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3133886","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]],"date-time":"2021-03-02T17:47:40.000Z","timestamp":1614707260000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]},"references-count":30,"journal-issue":{"issue":"OOPSLA"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/3133886"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3133886","relation":{},"ISSN":["2475-1421"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2475-1421"}],"subject":["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Software"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,18]],"date-time":"2021-07-18T23:24:17.000Z","timestamp":1626650657307},"reference-count":26,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IEEE Trans.

Data dependences have been used to represent only the relevant data flow relationships of a program. Control dependences are introduced to analogously represent only the essential control flow relationships of a program. Control dependences are derived from the usual control flow graph. Many traditional optimizations operate more efficiently on the PDG. Since dependences in the PDG connect computationally related parts of the program, a single walk of these dependences is sufficient to perform many optimizations. The PDG allows transformations such as vectorization, that previously required special treatment of control dependence, to be performed in a manner that is uniform for both control and data dependences. Program transformations that require interaction of the two dependence types can also be easily handled with our representation. As an example, an incremental approach to modifying data dependences resulting from branch deletion or loop unrolling is introduced. The PDG supports incremental optimization, permitting transformations to be triggered by one another and applied only to affected dependences.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/24039.24041","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,10,7]],"date-time":"2002-10-07T13:52:47.000Z","timestamp":1033998767000},"page":"319-349","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1353,"title":["The program dependence graph and its use in optimization"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Jeanne","family":"Ferrante","affiliation":[{"name":"IBM T.

because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,5,29]],"date-time":"2006-05-29T15:29:41.000Z","timestamp":1148916581000},"page":"1735-1780","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21927,"title":["Long Short-Term Memory"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Sepp","family":"Hochreiter","affiliation":[{"name":"Fakultät für Informatik, Technische Universität München, 80290 München, Germany"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Jürgen","family":"Schmidhuber","affiliation":[{"name":"IDSIA, Corso Elvezia 36, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"281","reference":[{}],"container-title":["Neural Computation"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,12]],"date-time":"2021-03-12T21:34:33.000Z","timestamp":1615584873000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,11,1]]},"references-count":20,"journal-issue":{"issue":"8"},"alternative-id":["10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735","relation":{},"ISSN":["0899-7667","1530-888X"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"0899-7667"},{"type":"electronic","value":"1530-888X"}],"subject":["Cognitive Neuroscience","Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)"],"published":{"date-parts":[[1997,11,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]],"date-time":"2021-05-20T12:14:42.000Z","timestamp":1621512882835},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":52,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background","start":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]],"date-time":"2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1503273600000},"delay-in-days":0,"content-version":"vor"}],"funder":[{"name":"U.S. Department of Homeland Security","DOI":"10.13039/100000180","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["HSHQDC-14-C-B0040"]},{"name":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","DOI":"10.13039/100000181","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["FA95501610030"]},{"name":"National Science Foundation","DOI":"10.13039/100000001","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["CCF-1252644, CNS-1629771, CCF-1618132"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]]},"DOI":"10.1145/3106237.3106244","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,2]],"date-time":"2017-08-02T19:36:18.000Z","timestamp":1501702578000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":28,"title":["µDroid: an energy-aware mutation testing framework for Android"],"prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Reyhaneh","family":"Jabbarvand","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"},{"name":"University of California at Irvine, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Sam","family":"Malek","affiliation":[{"name":"University of California"},{"name":"University of California at Irvine, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]]},"reference":[{}],"container-title":["Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering"],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3106237.3106244","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]],"date-time":"2020-12-16T14:06:28.000Z","timestamp":1608127588000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]]},"references-count":52,"alternative-id":["10.1145/3106237.3106244","10.1145/3106237"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3106237.3106244","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,21]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,9]],"date-time":"2021-07-09T16:46:53.000Z","timestamp":1625849213907},"reference-count":58,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"5","funder":[{"name":"Singapore MoE Tier 2","award":["MOE2013-T2-1-115"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IIEEE Trans.

Our method uses the abstract semantics of the underlying DSL to find a program\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            whose\n            <jats:italic>abstract</jats:italic>\n            behavior satisfies the examples. However, since program\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            may be spurious with respect to the concrete semantics, our approach iteratively refines the abstraction until we either find a program that satisfies the examples or prove that no such DSL program exists. Because many programs have the same input-output behavior in terms of their\n            <jats:italic>abstract semantics</jats:italic>\n            , this synthesis methodology significantly reduces the search space compared to existing techniques that use purely concrete semantics.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            While\n            <jats:italic>synthesis using abstraction refinement (SYNGAR)</jats:italic>\n            could be implemented in different settings, we propose a refinement-based synthesis algorithm that uses\n            <jats:italic>abstract finite tree automata (AFTA)</jats:italic>\n            . Our technique uses a coarse initial program abstraction to construct an initial AFTA, which is iteratively refined by constructing a\n            <jats:italic>proof of incorrectness</jats:italic>\n            of any spurious program. In addition to ruling out the spurious program accepted by the previous AFTA, proofs of incorrectness are also useful for ruling out many other spurious programs.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We implement these ideas in a framework called Blaze, which can be instantiated in different domains by providing a suitable DSL and its corresponding concrete and abstract semantics. We have used the Blaze framework to build synthesizers for string and matrix transformations, and we compare Blaze with existing techniques. Our results for the string domain show that Blaze compares favorably with FlashFill, a domain-specific synthesizer that is now deployed in Microsoft PowerShell. In the context of matrix manipulations, we compare Blaze against Prose, a state-of-the-art general-purpose VSA-based synthesizer, and show that Blaze results in a 90x speed-up over Prose. In both application domains, Blaze also consistently improves upon the performance of two other existing techniques by at least an order of magnitude.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3158151","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,29]],"date-time":"2017-12-29T14:21:49.000Z","timestamp":1514557309000},"page":"1-30","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":22,"title":["Program
