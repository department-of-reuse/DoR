The goal is to cover all of SE in the last 10 years. 

To do that, we NLP tools that can extract these links. 

And to certify those tools we need some human-generated ground truth.

So, at least initially, we have to sample a few venues to see what we can find.

For the 2022:

- ASE
- EMSE
- FSE
- ICSE  
- ICSME 
- MSR
- SANER

Also, there are several issues at https://github.com/department-of-reuse/DoR/projects/2 that need to be finished off.
